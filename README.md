# The Project
 This is a personal challenge and practice project using a real world case, my mother's school. Since it's a small school, it does'nt have a webpage, and I decided to make one using what I had learned this far. Since I started this project I've learned a lot of new things that I would like to change in this project, but it would demand too much time, so I decided to continue working with what I had and at least come to a presentable conclusion. My idea is to keep improving or even remaking this project with the new concepts and knowledge that I gain and learn.
